    <textarea>As programs get bigger, they also become more complex and harder to understand. We all think ourselves
        pretty clever, of course, but we are mere human beings, and even a moderate amount of chaos tends to baffle us.
        And then it all goes downhill. Working on something you do not really understand is a bit like cutting random
        wires on those time-activated bombs they always have in movies. If you are lucky, you might get the right one ―
        especially if you are the hero of the movie and strike a suitably dramatic pose ― but there is always the
        possibility of blowing everything up.

        Admittedly, in most cases, breaking a program does not cause any large explosions. But when a program, by
        someone's ignorant tinkering, has degenerated into a ramshackle mass of errors, reshaping it into something
        sensible is a terrible labour ― sometimes you might just as well start over.

        Thus, the programmer is always looking for ways to keep the complexity of his programs as low as possible. An
        important way to do this is to try and make code more abstract. When writing a program, it is easy to get
        sidetracked into small details at every point. You come across some little issue, and you deal with it, and then
        proceed to the next little problem, and so on. This makes the code read like a grandmother's tale.

        Yes, dear, to make pea soup you will need split peas, the dry kind. And you have to soak them at least for a
        night, or you will have to cook them for hours and hours. I remember one time, when my dull son tried to make
        pea soup. Would you believe he hadn't soaked the peas? We almost broke our teeth, all of us. Anyway, when you
        have soaked the peas, and you'll want about a cup of them per person, and pay attention because they will expand
        a bit while they are soaking, so if you aren't careful they will spill out of whatever you use to hold them, so
        also use plenty water to soak in, but as I said, about a cup of them, when they are dry, and after they are
        soaked you cook them in four cups of water per cup of dry peas. Let it simmer for two hours, which means you
        cover it and keep it barely cooking, and then add some diced onions, sliced celery stalk, and maybe a carrot or
        two and some ham. Let it all cook for a few minutes more, and it is ready to eat.

        Another way to describe this recipe:

        Per person: one cup dried split peas, half a chopped onion, half a carrot, a celery stalk, and optionally ham.

        Soak peas overnight, simmer them for two hours in four cups of water (per person), add vegetables and ham, and
        cook for ten more minutes.

        This is shorter, but if you don't know how to soak peas you'll surely screw up and put them in too little water.
        But how to soak peas can be looked up, and that is the trick. If you assume a certain basic knowledge in the
        audience, you can talk in a language that deals with bigger concepts, and express things in a much shorter and
        clearer way. This, more or less, is what abstraction is.

        How is this far-fetched recipe story relevant to programming? Well, obviously, the recipe is the program.
        Furthermore, the basic knowledge that the cook is supposed to have corresponds to the functions and other
        constructs that are available to the programmer. If you remember the introduction of this book, things like
        while make it easier to build loops, and in chapter 4 we wrote some simple functions in order to make other
        functions shorter and more straightforward. Such tools, some of them made available by the language itself,
        others built by the programmer, are used to reduce the amount of uninteresting details in the rest of the
        program, and thus make that program easier to work with.
        Functional programming, which is the subject of this chapter, produces abstraction through clever ways of
        combining functions. A programmer armed with a repertoire of fundamental functions and, more importantly, the
        knowledge on how to use them, is much more effective than one who starts from scratch. Unfortunately, a standard
        JavaScript environment comes with deplorably few essential functions, so we have to write them ourselves or,
        which is often preferable, make use of somebody else's code (more on that in chapter 9).

        There are other popular approaches to abstraction, most notably object-oriented programming, the subject of
        chapter 8.
